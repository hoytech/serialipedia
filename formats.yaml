## Serialipedia -- Meta-data related to popular serialization formats

##
## We're trying to keep this restricted to "general purpose" formats although
## that is flexible. As a rule of thumb, formats should have implementations
## in at least 2 languages.
##
## When it's fleshed out enough we'll render it into a fancy web-page, complete
## with filtering, grouping by tags, cross-referenced benchmarks, etc.
